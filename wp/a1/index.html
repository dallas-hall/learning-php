                <th>Have you any programming or web design experience?</th>
                <td><p>I have been trying to learn to program with Java for about 5 years. I did a diploma a few years which had Java and COBOL in it.  I was able to pass the course but I didn't really understand what I was doing.  I didn't practice it for a year or so and lost it.  I tried coming back and struggled quite a bit (with math and logic mainly) and kept stopping and coming back.  I spent 12 months before doing Programming 1 doing the first section of a Java textbook called Objects First with BlueJ.  During Programming 1 I did all of the recommended textbook chapters and some additional stuff and I really started to grasp it this time.  I feel it was a combination of previous study, new knowledge, and spending a lot of time each day reading heory and writing code.  After that subject I feel that I have a solid grasp on the introductory object orientated concepts and Java.
</p><p>My last subject was Software Architecture: Design and Implementation, which I learnt a lot more advanced things related to Java and software design in general.  I have built a couple of programs for work that I would consider advanced, one being a GUI wrapper for a database CLI ETL program and another implementing AES encryption for data inside a database.  Also, I have minimal experience in web design, I did some basic HTML in high school in 1998 (lol) but I never really understood what I was doing.  I also did the <a href="www.htmldog.com"> HTML Dog</a> HTML and CSS tutorials in 2013 and I have used HTML a little here and there, nothing major though.  I look forward to learning more about the subject and building my own website, which will be a blog about my learning journey.  I also plan to use my Mum's existing business website for assignment 2 and I am going to rebuild it for her.  It is really good timing because she wanted to rebuild it anyway.</p></td>

                <th>Do you see yourself as a programmer or designer, or both?</th>
                <td>I a see myself as a programmer more than a designer.  But I did do the User Centred Design unit and I found that really interesting.  I really enjoyed designing my own mobile application for the assignment in that unit.  I'd like to get better at both though, and I plan to do that through study and practice.</td>

                <th>What has brought you to this course at RMIT?</th>
                <td>In 2012 I joined the federal government as an ICT apprentice with no industry training or experience and they paid for me to do a diploma in ICT, which had a systems analysis and design focus.  Once I finished that I decided that I wanted to turn my diploma in a degree, because I thought that if I didn't keep studying I never would. My motivation for studying is mainly to satisfy a life long interest in computer science that started when my mother bought an x86 Amstrad computer in the late 1980s.  But studying has certainly helped out in my career progression in the ICT industry as well and that is another motivation.  I have used knowledge and experience from study in my work as a systems analyst, a data analyst, and a database administrator.  Once I finish this course in early 2019, I plan to take a year off from official study (but I plan to learn C and C++ myself) so I can travel to Europe with my wife for a couple of months.  But then in 2020 I plan to do a masters, either in data science or information security.</td>

                <th>What are you hoping to get out of the course?</th>
                <td>I hope to learn about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP in general.  I am also happy that I am able to connect to the RMIT RHEL servers and practice using the linux command line.  So I am hoping to be able to build and maintain my own website at the end of this, and also to rebuild one of my Mother's business websites.  I also will use this opportunity to learn more about linux.  I am currently writing this assignment using vim while I am connected to the RHEL server via a ssh connection in my linux terminal.  I already have learnt more about linux permissions due to our discussion on the forum!</td>

                <td>I would prefer to work alone so I can just focus on designing and coding myself.  I have had mixed experiences with group assignments. My main strengths would be:
			<ul>
				<li>Determination - I don't like to quit things</li>
				<li>Focus - I can have a laser like focus when working</li>
				<li>Communication - I learnt how to communicate with people when I was a system analyst</li>
				<li>Some technical knowledge & experience - I know a little about a lot, just enough to be dangerous!</li>
