			<h2>Our Team</h2>
			<h3>Jack Egerton - Formerly Channel 7 TV</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>TV Director/producer/cameraman with over 30 years broadcast experience.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It was by accident Jack (John) Egerton was lead into a career in TV his passion was working with cattle
				and farming. He was serving petrol at his family garage when he met someone from Channel 7 who offered
				him some work experience and he said yes. That led him into the career of TV. All areas of production
				from filming, setting up studio for sets and filming live TV including telethons and regular network
				shows. Location shoots including major events, sporting events, filming news stories and documentaries
				to name a few. Then the versatile skills of the cameraman/director/editor always came in handy even when
				setting up brand new studio when the industry changed formats.</p>
			<p>Award Winning Director Producer Cameraman – Many awards for his TV work and news stories for various TV
				Networks through his career. When Jack joined Golden Tree Productions in 2004 it was a very exciting new
				step in his career to be able to work on projects he was passionate about and allow his natural creative
				flair to soar to new heights. His very first project was to write/create/ film/and produce a dvd for
				Hinkler Books on the Simply Tarot Project. This required him actually learning about the Tarot Cards
				worked and so he actually studies and attended a Tarot course with Amanda before this project commenced.
				This enabled him to have a great understanding of how the tarot cards worked and bring to life in the
				dvd a nd the rest is history as they say as it went on to win awards also. Wrote Filmed & Directed The
				Award Winning “Simply Tarot DVD “with Amanda Hall Simply Tarot for Hinkler Books Australia.</p>
			<h3>Amanda Hall Psychic</h3>
			<p>I commenced my journey into Psychic work when I was very young. Now with a career spanning over 40 years
				Tarot has always been my passion but I also love working with Astrology I have been fortunate to receive
				many industry awards for my Psychic work. Including Psychic Hall Of Fame 2013 then Psychic Of The Year
				2014-15-16</p>
			<p>I just love working with the Tarot Cards as they are picture cards and share with us their story of your
				life is changing and for ever evolving as we move through life. I took up Astrology very early in my
				career as it had always fascinated me and was drawn to the heavens. Astrology is a researched science
				and this appealed to me as it was not guess work or open to vague interpretation. There was definite
				time factors and guide lines to follow and this gave precise information and guidance. Working with
				candles were always used when I was working with the Tarot Card, reading teaching or just writing
				another course. I always feel they clear the energy and make it pure and protected ready for work. As
				candles were always burning during my work it was not unrealistic to gravitate into designing a candle
				range for my own personal use and then I made them available for my customers to bring changes into
				their busy lives.</p>
			<p>Then in the early 1980’s I commenced teaching Tarot in the Australian College System. This enabled me to
				write the Award Winning Best Selling – Simply Tarot for Hinkler Books Australia. Book, DVD & Tarot
				Cards. Recently Hinkler Books expanded our Tarot Stable to include the brand new Secrets Of Tarot
				Kit.</p>
			<p>Now I have my very own weekly show The Amanda Hall Psychic Show on A1R Psychic Radio 0n Moonstruck TV –
				YouTube – Facebook and many various other platforms.</p>
