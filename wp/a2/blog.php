				<h3>What Chemicals?</h3>
				<p>Yes they are a chemical cocktail of many ingredients such as
					petroleum, benzene and alpha-pinene can be present the most common chemical released is
					limonene.</p>
				<h3>Why Choose 100% Eco Natural Soy Candles?</h3>
				<p>Eco Soy candles are made from natural ingredients, which are bio degradable and
					renewable. Eco Soy candles are nontoxic, burn clean leaving behind a sparking glass
					container. So the choice becomes very clear for your health and well being Natural Eco
					Soy Candles with lead free wicks.</p>
				<h3>Burn Times?</h3>
				<p>You can expect a longer burn time up to 50% longer than normal candles. The fragrance of
					the candle lasts throughout the whole burning of the candle. Eco Soy candles do not get
					hot, even when burning. But beware the container glass the candle is burning it will get
					hot during the burning process.</p>
				<h3>Clean Up If I spill the candle?</h3>
				<p>Soy candles are easy to clean up with water if you spill the candle accidentally.</p>
				<h3>Getting ready to use your candle?</h3>
				<p>Before you burn your Soy Candle, always keep the wick trimmed to about 4-5 cm and this
					will increase burn time. Always place your soy candle on a glass plate of coaster never
					direct on table. Make sure you always extinguish your candle with snuffer or glass
					snuffer lid. Always burn your candle in a safe location. Never place in a direct draft
					or under fan. Always keep away from children.</p>

				<h3>Gerry Crow</h3>
				<p>You should be proud Amanda! These candles are impressive, with unique spiritual, magical and healing
					properties. I have had very strong spiritual experiences while meditating with the beautiful Healing
					candle that you gave me. As soon as I lit it I had the vision of an ancient medicine woman. I heard
					her chanting and felt the blue healing light around her. She wasn’t one of my mob However she did
					take her place in the circle of light that I work within and gave healing that was extended to all,
					thru the circle. It was Amazing, to be purchasing for my personal use and in my healing and readings
					with others! Thank you, thank you, thank you to you and all involved in creating the candles They
					are very special indeed!!!! Looking forward to seeing you XXXOOO</p>
