		<h2>Business / Organisation Name and Description</h2>
		<p>The business I will be working with is called <a
				href="http://www.goldentreeproductions.com.au/" target="_blank">Golden
			Tree Productions.</a>
			It is a company that my mother and her partner runs.
			They were going to rebuild this website soon so the timing worked
			out great, I can do it for my assignment and learn about web-dev and
			they can rebuild their site for free.</p>
		<h3>Company Overview</h3>
		<p>Golden Tree Productions` journey began in 2004 on the Gold Coast, in
			Queensland Australia.
			They evolved from Golden Tree Wholistic Health which commenced in
			2000 with a dream to share with the public their knowledge through
			education and awareness.
			This dream included introducing the wonderful world of the Psychic
			Modalities and the Complimentary Therapies.
			The dream really started to be come reality through our very own
			style of new age exposition, which was known as the Sun, Moon, &amp;
			Star Lifestyle Expo.
			This expo became an institution in South East Queensland with the
			amazing contribution, support, and encouragement from a variety of
			people and sponsors.
		</p>
		<p>After the success of Sun, Moon, &amp; Star Lifestyle Expo and with
			our experienced team of experts in most areas of the "New Age
			Revolution", we opened our clinic in Currumbin.
			Our talented team commenced classes, workshops, &amp; lectures in a
			variety of subjects.
			In 2004 an experienced, talented, and award winning television
			producer joined the organisation and Golden Tree Production added
			video production to its skillset.
			A new project was undertaken to redesign the traditional Rider-Waite
			tarot deck and to provide a modern and simple way to learn tarot.
			Simply Tarot was born and the rest as they say, is history.
			Today Golden Tree Production still provides tarot and video
			production services, but has branched out further still by
			publishing books and doing segments on radio, television, and
			internet media.

		<h2>Color Palette</h2>
		<p>These colours were chosen using <a
				href="https://material.io/color/#!/" target="_blank">Google's
			Color Tool</a>, based on their <a
				href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material
			Design guidelines</a> for <a
				href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html"
				target="_blank">Style & Colours</a>
			The original colours chosen have been changed as once the site
			was built it didn't look and feel right.  So the final colours
			chosen by the client can be <a
					href="https://material.io/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=1&primary.color=f2d181&secondary.color=F44336"
					target="_blank">previewed here also.</a></p>
		<div id='palette'>
			Primary Colours<br>
			<span class='hue1-1'></span>
			<span class='hue1-2'></span>
			<span class='hue1-3'></span>
			<span class='black'></span><br>

			Secondary colours<br>
			<span class='hue2-1'></span>
			<span class='hue2-2'></span>
			<span class='hue2-3'></span>
			<span class='white'></span>

		<h2>Images and Background Images</h2>
		<p>The client has created a new logo and that will be used as a
			transparent background image on some pages. The page has been
			created using the 960 grid concept, so the colour outside the 960
			grid is the dark colour (3) from the first set of colours, and the
			background colour inside the 960 grid is the main colour (1) from
			the first set of colours.
			The images below are a small sample of what will be included in the
			site.
