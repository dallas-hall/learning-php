      <h2>Business / Organisation Name and Description</h2>
      <p>The business I will be working with is called <a href="http://www.goldentreeproductions.com.au/" target="_blank">Golden Tree Productions.</a>
	It is a company that my mother and her partner runs.
	They were going to rebuild this website soon so the timing worked out great, I can do it for my assignment and learn about web-dev and they can rebuild their site for free.</p>
   <h3>Company Overview</h3>
    <p>Golden Tree Productions` journey began in 2004 on the Gold Coast, in Queensland Australia.
        They evolved from Golden Tree Wholistic Health which commenced in 2000 with a dream to share with the public their knowledge through education and awareness.
        This dream included introducing the wonderful world of the Psychic Modalities and the Complimentary Therapies.
        The dream really started to be come reality through our very own style of new age exposition, which was known as the Sun, Moon, &amp; Star Lifestyle Expo.
        This expo became an institution in South East Queensland with the amazing contribution, support, and encouragement from a variety of people and sponsors.
    </p>
    <p>After the success of Sun, Moon, &amp; Star Lifestyle Expo and with our experienced team of experts in most areas of the "New Age Revolution", we opened our clinic in Currumbin.
        Our talented team commenced classes, workshops, &amp; lectures in a variety of subjects.
        In 2004 an experienced, talented, and award winning television producer joined the organisation and Golden Tree Production added video production to its skillset.
        A new project was undertaken to redesign the traditional Rider-Waite tarot deck and to provide a modern and simple way to learn tarot.
        Simply Tarot was born and the rest as they say, is history.
        Today Golden Tree Production still provides tarot and video production services, but has branched out further still by publishing books and doing segments on radio, television, and internet media.

      <h2>Color Palette</h2>
      <p>These colours were chosen using <a href="https://material.io/color/#!/" target="_blank">Google's Color Tool</a>, based on their <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/" target="_blank">Material Design guidelines</a> for <a href="https://material.io/guidelines/style/color.html" target="_blank">Style & Colours</a>
The final colours chosen by the client can be <a href ="https://material.io/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=1&primary.color=f2d181&secondary.color=DC143C" target="_blank">previewed here also.</a></p>

      <h2>Images and Background Images</h2>
      <p>Website paragraph text should be mixed with images and the overall look of a website can be enhanced with background images, be they full size images or smaller "tiling" images. Update the links of these sample images once you have uploaded images to your img directory.</p>
	<p>The client couldn't decide on a back image, tiled background images, or a single colour just yet.
	For now the first colour in the above primary colour has been flagged as the site's background colour.
	The images below are a small sample of what will be included in the site.
