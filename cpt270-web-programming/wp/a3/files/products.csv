"simplyTarotSetDVD","Simply Tarot Set With DVD","<h2>Can I Teach Myself Tarot?</h2>
<p>Yes we can also teach our selves Tarot. It is very easy with our step-by-step-guide to learning Tarot with my tried and tested method.</p>
<p>During my time teaching students over the years it was always hard for them to remember the meaning of the cards from their work book. So I suggested we print the meaning on the bottom of the card. This made teaching so easy for me and the students love it. Reading the Tarot became easy and they were confident with ability quickly. We chose to make a DVD for those people who find it easier to learn visually. Our book is mirror of the DVD and this makes it easy to reference when performing a reading.</p>
<p>This Simply Tarot Set includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simply Tarot Training DVD.</li>
